# ZweefAppAnalyser
This is an analyser for the ZweefApp which provides all necessary data from your flights (total hours / starts, type hours / starts, ...)

# How to start
To use this project, download the executable and run it in a directory containing the csv of your flights (as exported from the ZweefApp). You will see a command line with some text, and a question whether you want to use the located file. If this is correct, enter "Y" and press enter. 
If this is not correct enter "N" (really any key will suffice) and press enter. You can now enter the right file. Mind that you will have to use the absolute path for this with the ".csv" extension.

Next you will be shown a pilot name. This is retrieved from your supplied file, so there is little chance this will be wrong. In case this is the right pilot name, enter "Y" to the question and press enter. If it is wrong, enter "N" and press enter. You can now enter your own name and press enter again.

Now you will be shown a full list of your flight times per type, as well as other information such as overlands and exam / solo dates.

In case you would like to expand on this or fix errors, feel free to do so.
